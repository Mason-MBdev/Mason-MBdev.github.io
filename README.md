## Description

My website for hosting software/hobby projects, with a few interactive features.

## Features

- **Project Listings**: Each project has embedded videos, and links to the live site & code repositories.
- **Contact Form**: Submissions lead to a server behind an NGINX proxy, where messages are printed in real-time to a screen on my desk.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout.

## Technology Used

- **HTML & CSS**: Structure and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Handles form submissions to the server via Fetch API.
- **NGINX**: Proxy server handling contact page submissions.
- **Font Awesome**: Nice icons for UI elements.

## Future Plans

- Expand the backend to integrate new applications and monitoring.
